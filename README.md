# Portfolio Website

I wanted a place to showcase the projects that I work on, what better way than to create a portfolio. 

Website runs on: **https://justinnegron.me**

# Features

Used [detect.js](https://github.com/darcyclarke/Detect.js/) to apply respective backgrounds for different screen resolutions. <br>
Used a typing function from an online template, tweaked for my specific use case. <br>
Used a translate3d feature from another online template, this is only used for desktop browsers. <br>

# Tools

* Hosted on a Raspberry PI 4
* NGINX Reverse Proxy and Web Server
* Cloudflare DNS
* Namecheap Domain
